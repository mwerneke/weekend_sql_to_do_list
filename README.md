## Weekend Challenge: SQL To-Do List

Hello Primers! 

Welcome to your weekend challenge!

Full stack is pretty awesome, huh? The idea that you are able to spin up a full application architecture in such a short time is pretty incredible. This weekend is all about showing us that you have a handle on each of the different parts of the full stack. 

## The To-Do App

You are going to create a 'TO DO' application. This type of application is very common to tackle when learning a new language, which makes it extremely valuable to work through for the first time. Chances are good that at some point in your career you will tackle this again while learning another language.

**Here are the specific components for the challenge:**

[x] Create an inpute to store a task
[] On create button, it should be store in Databse
[] When task is created, it should be appended to DOM showing tasks to be completed
[] Each inserted task should have a deleteBtn and completeBtn
[] Make sure that when task is marked complete, the container on Dom changes it from Gray to Green  -- in CSS
[] In Database have Completed Column True or False - Boolean
[] When Deleted, it should be removed from front and back end


### Styling

Use CSS styling to move the aesthetic of the page beyond the vanilla HTML look:
  - background color of the page
  - font family and size
  - text color & or background color of tasks *to show whether or not they have been completed

### Database Structure

[]Add all queries to the databse

## Stretch Goals

For each of your strech goals, you will be practicing git branching. Please refer to the branching notes for a reminder on commands. Each branch will be merged into master using `--no-ff`. This will allow us to see that you branched your feature when you turn in your code.

- `feature-styling-bootstrap` 

    - [ ]  Add Bootstrap to the front end and style it up!
      -  Buttons -- make the creation buttons and completion buttons green and the delete red.
      -  Inputs -- make your text inputs styled in the bootstrap way
      -  Responsive -- make your app responsive to different screen sizes -- check out the [Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) section

- `feature-confirm-delete`

    - [ ]  In whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes / no' option when deleting a task.
        - Some styled options are [Bootstrap Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/) or [Sweet Alerts](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/): Use the CDN option.

- `feature-ordering-task-query` 

    - [ ]  Research [Query Params](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query) to have the request reverse the order of the returned todos. 
    
- `feature-time-completed` 

    - [ ]  Add the ability to record when a task was completed. Show the completed date on the frontend in a pretty format.
